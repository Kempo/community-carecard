      "GENERAL": [
        {
          "Q": "What is Community Carecard?",
          "A": "Community Carecard is a way to support local businesses that have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. By purchasing a gift card online, you’re giving your favorite local business money now in exchange for goods or services later. This immediate cash flow will help sustain businesses during closures or slow sales caused by this unprecedented situation. "
        },
        {
          "Q": "Who’s behind this initiative?",
          "A": "Though Community Carecard is the brain trust of several small business enthusiasts, it really took shape when Lee Anne Grant, Chief Business Officer of The Assembly; Mike McCormick, an Associate Partner at Great Point Ventures; and former Googlers Paul Huynh and Peter Szalontay brought their respective projects together. They all share a passion of finding effective ways to build and sustain communities, amplify compassion and humanity, and connect people to make the world a better place."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Where are you located?",
          "A": "The Community Carecard team is supported by a group of impassioned leaders who have come together online since the outbreak via different COVID help networks and incubators. We’re truly a global and diverse team, with members located in San Francisco, Colombia, London, and beyond. Let us know hello@ccarecard.com if you’d like to help us deploy to more businesses in your area."

      ],
      "SUPPORTERS": [
        {
          "Q": "How does it work?",
          "A": "Three very easy steps: <br/> <br/> <strong>Support:</strong> Find your favorite local business by name or zip code. Purchase a gift card or give a tip — the business gets paid immediately <br/> <strong>Share:</strong> Show the business owners you support them — and show your neighbors how they can help — by sharing on social <br/> <strong>Enjoy:</strong> Feel good about helping a local business and, once it reopens, enjoy its services by redeeming your Community Carecard."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Are these like regular gift cards?",
          "A": "Yes and no. If you buy a $100 Community Carecard today, you’ll be able to redeem it for $100 worth of goods or services when your favorite local business reopens. <br/> <br/> But, it’s important to note that our gift cards are <strong>one-time use</strong> only. Translation: If you have a $25 gift card to your favorite restaurant, but only spend $22 at dinner, you will <i>not</i> be able to use that $3 balance at a later date. <br/> <br/> That’s not because we’re trying to fleece you; that’s because we’re trying to get this initiative off the ground quickly — and get your money to the business owners who desperately need it. We’ve worked our way around this issue by offering an array of gift card denominations. At your local coffee shop, for example, we’d advise buying five $5 gift cards rather than one $25 gift card."
        },
        {
          "Q": "What are tips?",
          "A": "We’ve also built in the ability to “tip” a business, which is basically a way of showing your appreciation and support. <br/> <br/> While you won’t receive goods or services in exchange for your tip, you can feel good knowing you’ve helped a deserving entrepreneur (and their hardworking staff) during a tough time. <br/> Please note, donations to for-profit businesses are not tax deductible."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How do I choose which local businesses to support?",
          "A": "With all the deserving local businesses out there, we know it can be hard to narrow your list. We suggest starting with the shops and stores that you love and visit most. Search for them on our site. <br/> <br/> After you’ve taken care of your favorites, consider other businesses in your community — like local bookstores and salons — that social distancing rules and closures may have hit the hardest."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Is there another way I can support a business besides buying a gift card?",
          "A": "Yes! You can spread the word about Community Carecard to businesses and customers alike. Encourage local businesses to sign up (it’s free for them!), and encourage your friends and neighbors to support their favorites. <br/> We also offer a “tipping” option, where your money goes straight to a business’ bank account — without the requirement or expectation of future services and goods. This is a very generous way to give back to your local community favorites. <br/> Of course, this is a community affair — so if you have any recommendations for how we can work together to support local businesses, please let us know at hello@ccarecard.com."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Do the gift cards expire?",
          "A": "No, but we encourage you to redeem them as soon as your favorite shops reopen for business."
        },
        {
          "Q": "My favorite business isn’t listed — what should I do?",
          "A": "Our list of businesses is pulled from Google’s database of 150 million places around the world. Using this system allows us to include as many businesses as possible. While we can’t currently add any businesses that aren’t on this list, we may offer that feature in the future."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Does Community Carecard charge fees to local businesses?",
          "A": "<strong>Nope!</strong> Today, we’re solely focused on providing relief to local businesses and directing as much financial aid to them as possible. <br/> <br/> When you buy a gift card or send a tip, our payment processing partner charges a small fee (2.5% + $0.30). We add this amount to your purchase so that 100% of your money goes directly to the local business you love. <br/> <br/> The Community Carecard team is staffed entirely by volunteers, though we accept and encourage donations to offset our operating costs. You can help us continue to grow by checking the “Support Community Carecard” box at checkout."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Can Community Carecards be used to make online purchases?",
          "A": "Community Carecards were created to support in-person purchases at brick + mortar locations and cannot be used for online purchases at this time."
        },
        {
          "Q": "What happens if the business never reopens its doors? Do I get my money back?",
          "A": "While we hope that Community Carecards will enable every local business to weather the coronavirus pandemic, we know that may not always be the case. <br/> <br/> Yet, because we immediately funnel the funds from your gift card purchase to the business itself, Community Carecard cannot issue refunds if the business folds. <br/> <br/> That sucks — there’s no way around it. But, if it happens, we hope you’ll take heart in the fact you did your part to keep local businesses alive."
        }
      ],
      "BUSINESSES": [
        {
          "Q": "Why should I participate in the Community Carecard program?",
          "A": "We believe in strength in numbers and the power of community. <br/> <br/> The more businesses that sign up for Community Carecard, the more awareness we can generate — and, hopefully, the more customers who will participate. While you can, of course, sell gift certificates over the phone, many customers (cough, millennials) are more comfortable with digital purchases. Additionally, imagine a world where you can sell gift cards even while you’re asleep at night, that’s what our platform can bring to your business! <br/> <br/> Our seamless implementation process allows you to start selling digital gift cards <strong>in under five minutes</strong>, without you having to make any phone calls, wrangle any software, or pay a single cent. We’re in this for you."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How do I receive payment?",
          "A": "For every  transaction, revenue generated from the sale of gift cards will be instantly transferred to the business bank account or debit account verified by you (business owner) during the Community Carecard registration process."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How can I add my business to your site?",
          "A": "We’re delighted you’re on board! To list your business with Community Carecard, please click ‘Register my Business’ at the top of the page. We’ll work with you to verify the listing and get you up and running ASAP.<br /><br />Once you’ve been verified with Community Carecard (we just want to make sure you’re the rightful owner), we will send you a link to start the simple registration process with our partner Stripe Connect which will enable you to assign your bank details so you can get paid via direct deposit. In a matter of a few clicks from start to finish, you will be set up and ready to not only sell digital gift cards but also receive payments directly to your designated bank account<br /><br />PS. Since we’re staffed by volunteers and working with as many business owners as possible, your patience is greatly appreciated."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How can I get my customers to buy gift cards?",
          "A": "We’re living in unprecedented times, and everyone’s looking for ways to help — including your loyal customers. We encourage you to share your Community Carecard profile through your regular channels: social media platforms, email newsletters, even a big sign in your window. In your communications, make sure to express how the coronavirus has affected your business and how digital gift card purchases are vital to helping you stay afloat."
        },
        {
          "Q": "When will customers be able to start redeeming their gift cards?",
          "A": "Ideally, your loyal customers can redeem their gift cards as soon as you reopen. Otherwise, we’ll set a tentative date of May 1st, 2020.. With the uncertainties ahead, as well as your ability to resume normal operations being tied to government restrictions, we’ll work with you to create a strategy that benefits both you and your favorite customers."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How can I track gift card purchases and redemptions?",
          "A": "Today, you will receive an email notification for each gift card sold with a unique code, name of purchaser, date purchased and the amount purchased. In the future, we are working to develop a more robust system to help you track and manage the purchase and redemption process. We would love to work with you to better understand your needs as a small business owner and build out a comprehensive system to deliver for you."
